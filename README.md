# km_per_polygon
Small app that allows you to upload a GTFS file with "shapes.txt" and a set of polygons and get the number of kilometers each route does per area.

Deployed with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/). Map with [Pydeck](https://pydeck.gl/). 

You can take a look to the app [here.](https://kmperpolygon-remix.streamlit.app/)
